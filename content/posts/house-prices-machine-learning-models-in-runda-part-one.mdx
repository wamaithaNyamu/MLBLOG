datascience project for determining housing prices in runda" />


Runda is a suburb in the heart of Nairobi. Its an estate of the who is who in the country. Due to the status quo of
the class of citizens that live here, it is expected that the price of land and houses are off the roof (well, from
the common mwananchis perspective anyway). This notebook walks through investigating housing prices in Runda. The
data has been scrapped from BuyRentKenya. Full code for this tutorial series can be found     [here](https://github.com/wamaithaNyamu/RUNDAHOUSES/)

```python

# cleaning
def clean_description(text):
  """
  args text {String} the description of the current house
  return text {String} returns a string of the preprocessed description

  """
  pattern = re.compile(r'((?<=[^\W[A-Z])[A-Z]|(?<=\S)[A-Z](?=[a-z]))')
  # removing paragraph numbers
  text = re.sub('[0-9]+.\t','',str(text))
  # removing new line
  text = re.sub('\n ','',str(text))

  text = re.sub('\\n',' ',str(text))
  # removing apostrophes
  text = re.sub("'s",'',str(text))
  # removing commas
  text = re.sub(",",'',str(text))
  # remove astreisk
  # text = re.sub("*",'',str(text))
  # removing hyphens
  text = re.sub("-",' ',str(text))
  text = re.sub("â€” ",'',str(text))
  # add space between words with caps
  text = pattern.sub(r' \1', str(text))




  return text
